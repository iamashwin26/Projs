Laser light usually a spatially coherent,
narrow low-divergence beam, that can be manipulated

with lenses.
In this experiment our aim is to find the

laser beam divergence and spotsize using a
detector.

The light emitted by a laser is confined to
a rather narrow cone; but, as the beam propagates

outward, it slowly diverges or fans out.
At the output aperture of the laser, the beam

diameter is d.
Its beam divergence angle , usually expressed

in milliradians.
In traversing a distance , the beam diverges

to a circle of diameter .
i.e, The beam divergence is an angular measure

of increase in beam diameter with distance
from the optical aperture from which the electromagnetic

beam emerges.

The spot size of the beam is the radial distance
-- from the center of maximum irradiance

or intensity to the 1/e2 points.
Procedure

set a laser and a detector(for measuring the
intensity) on an optical breadboard.

Align the laser beam -- in such a way that
laser beam can fall on detector.

Fix a distance for the detector -- and take
intensity measurements of the beam along a

horizontal line -- passing the point with
the maximum intensity.

Repeat the previous step for different variants.
Calculate the beam divergence by calculating

the maximum intensity of the beam,
which helps in calculating the beam spot size,

at different distances from the laser with
the help of the optical bread board.

Now, we can observe that the divergence of
a laser beam is proportional to its wavelength
21
00:02:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
-- and inversely proportional to the diameter
of the beam -- at its narrowest point.
