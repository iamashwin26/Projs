00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,930
Laser light usually a spatially coherent,
narrow low-divergence beam, that can be manipulated

2
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,560
with lenses.
In this experiment our aim is to find the

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,990
laser beam divergence and spotsize using a
detector.

4
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,910
The light emitted by a laser is confined to
a rather narrow cone; but, as the beam propagates

5
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:40,940
outward, it slowly diverges or fans out.
At the output aperture of the laser, the beam

6
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,250
diameter is d.
Its beam divergence angle , usually expressed

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,119
in milliradians.
In traversing a distance , the beam diverges

8
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:58,030
to a circle of diameter .
i.e, The beam divergence is an angular measure

9
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:04,580
of increase in beam diameter with distance
from the optical aperture from which the electromagnetic

10
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,330
beam emerges.

11
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,549
The spot size of the beam is the radial distance
 -- from the center of maximum irradiance

12
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:21,020
or intensity to the 1/e2 points.
Procedure

13
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,940
set a laser and a detector(for measuring the
intensity) on an optical breadboard.

14
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:34,510
Align the laser beam -- in such a way that
laser beam can fall on detector.

15
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,890
Fix a distance for the detector -- and take
intensity measurements of the beam along a

16
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:45,990
horizontal line -- passing the point with
the maximum intensity.

17
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:55,159
Repeat the previous step for different variants.
Calculate the beam divergence by calculating

18
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,780
the maximum intensity of the beam,
which helps in calculating the beam spot size,

19
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:10,139
at different distances from the laser with
the help of the optical bread board.

20
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:15,860
Now, we can observe that the divergence of
a laser beam is proportional to its wavelength

21
00:02:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
 -- and inversely proportional to the diameter
of the beam -- at its narrowest point.
